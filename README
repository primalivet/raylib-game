Raylib Game

---
PLATFORMS

Currently only supporting Darwin/MacOS.

DEPENDENCIES

Are handled by Nix, with the flake.nix file. It is responsible for dependencies as well as environment variables needed for compilation.

COMPILING

Build with regular GNU Make with `make` or into the nix store with `nix build`. Either way you get the executable `bin/game`.

LSP

This project assume Clang as the compiler (atleast from LSP point of view) and the command `make lsp` generates a `compile_commands.json` file for the LSP to use.
