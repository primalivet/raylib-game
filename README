Raylib Game

---

COMPILING

Currently using a Makefile to build the project isn't the best way, but favouring it for now as it's simple while flexible. The main drawback is that C libs installed with Homebrew aren't found because Homebrew has a bit arcane directory structure.

So this brings problems when trying to compile cross-platform and most probably issues with intel macs.

Anyway

The following command should print the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS for raylib and this is the only library used in this project.

echo $(pkg-config --libs --cflags raylib)

LSP

I'm using clangd language server, it has to know the compile command to work. This command has to be specified in a file call compile_commands.json. To generate it make sure you have the program "bear" installed ("brew install bear" on mac) and then run it over the Makefile with "bear -- make" to generate a "compile_commands.json".
