Raylib Game

---
PLATFORMS

Currently only supporting Darwin/MacOS.

COMPILING

The Makefile should be clear by itself (if familiar with make). The only third party library that is used is raylib and that is included in the vendor directory.

RUN THE GAME

After successfully compiling the game it should be just ./bin/game to run the game executable.

LSP

To use the clangd language server you need to create a compile_commands.json file. One way to create that file is to run make thorugh another program called bear, with "bear -- make". The bear program can be installed with Homebrew using "brew install bear".
